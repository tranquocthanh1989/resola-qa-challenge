Purpose
This test plan is acting as a guidline to verify the API Track Event which can be found here.
Specifically the test plan consists of test objects, assumption, test data preparation, list of test cases, risk management and high level estimation.
We will frequently update the plan if there is any changes in specification and requirement.

Test objects and approach
The API Track Event is a POST method
The test is considered to be done when we go through all the test cases and with PASSED status.
A smoke test is conducted at the end of Sprint if we have time, and it will check the mix of actions which included this event/call. For examples User adds 4 items into the Cart, then remove 1, add another into Wishlist and submit the Cart.

Assumption
The API is called automatically when User perfomed 

Test data

Test cases

Estimation:

Risk management:
- The Tester who reviewed this test cases are considered as the back-up resource
- If the endpoint is down, we will only test the happy cases
